    FM Transfers App

## General Info

I'm an admin in Football Manager community, where we play network games.
This app helps us to find necessary players for our teams by many parameters without opening the game.
The List of players can be very long, so the App has an infinite scroll and some optimization for searching.

Built with MERN stack and Redux.
